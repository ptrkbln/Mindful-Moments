## 📝 Gratitude Journal App DEMO

For my third and latest project, I crafted a **Gratitude Journal App DEMO** using pure **React** and leveraging **local storage** in the absence of a backend. This project draws inspiration from my psychology studies, aiming to encourage users to practice gratitude and become more mindful of the everyday blessings in their lives.

### Features:
- **Daily Topics:** Receive daily prompts and questions to reflect upon.
- **Timer & Meditation Music:** A soothing 2-minute timer accompanies meditation music to enhance your reflection time.
- **Journal Entry:** After the timer lapses, a journal entry opens for you to respond to the daily questions.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor your growth and reflections in the profile section.

✨ Experience the journey of gratitude and mindfulness!
